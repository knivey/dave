   Sure! Here's a simple Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw a colorful spiral. This should hopefully bring a smile to your face:

```python
import turtle
import random

# Set up the screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor("black")

# Create a turtle named "artist"
artist = turtle.Turtle()
artist.speed(0)  # Set the turtle speed to the maximum

colors = ["white", "blue", "green", "red", "yellow", "magenta", "cyan"]

def draw_spiral():
    for i in range(150):
        artist.color(random.choice(colors))  # Choose a random color from the list
        artist.forward(i)
        artist.left(59)  # Turn the turtle by 59 degrees

draw_spiral()

# Hide the turtle and display the result
artist.hideturtle()

# Keep the window open until closed by the user
turtle.done()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing Modules**:  
   We import `turtle` for drawing and `random` for selecting random colors.

2. **Screen Setup**:  
   `screen = turtle.Screen()` sets up the drawing window, and `screen.bgcolor("black")` changes its background color to black.

3. **Creating the Turtle**:  
   We create a turtle named `artist` which will do the drawing. Setting `artist.speed(0)` makes it draw as fast as possible.  
   1. lol
   2. omg

4. **Color List**:  
   We define a list of colors called `colors` which the turtle will randomly choose from while drawing.
   * moo
   * mrr

5. **Drawing the Spiral**:  
   The `draw_spiral` function makes the turtle draw a spiral. It iterates 150 times, chooses a random color, moves forward by an increasing number of steps, and turns 59 degrees.

6. **Final Touches**:  
   `artist.hideturtle()` hides the turtle after the drawing is complete, and `turtle.done()` keeps the window open until you close it manually.

You can run this code in a Python environment that supports GUI operations to see a colorful spiral pop up on your screen!
